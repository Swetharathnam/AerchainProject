SDE Assignment – AI-Powered RFP Management System
1. Context
Many companies run procurement through Requests for Proposal (RFPs): they define what they want to buy, 
email that out to multiple vendors, collect responses (often messy emails and attachments), and then 
someone manually compares all the quotes to decide who to award the work to.
This process is:
●
●
●
Slow and error-prone
Full of unstructured data (emails, PDFs, free-form descriptions)
Repetitive: similar RFPs, similar evaluations, similar comparisons
We want to explore how you would design and build an AI-powered RFP management system that 
streamlines this workflow end-to-end.
2. Problem Statement
Design and implement a single-user web application that helps a procurement manager:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Create RFPs
a.
b.
c.
A user should be able to describe what they want to buy in natural language.
Your system should turn this into a structured representation of an RFP that can be reused 
throughout the workflow (for sending to vendors, storing in a database, comparison, etc.).
Example chat interaction for RFP creation: "I need to procure laptops and monitors for our new office. 
Budget is $50,000 total. Need delivery within 30 days. We need 20 laptops with 16GB RAM and 15 
monitors 27-inch. Payment terms should be net 30, and we need at least 1 year warranty."
Manage vendors and send RFPs
a.
b.
c.
Maintain some form of vendor master data (who the vendors are and how to contact them).
Allow the user to choose which vendors to send an RFP to.
Send the RFP to vendors via email.
Receive and interpret vendor responses
a.
b.
c.
a.
Support inbound email, where vendors reply with their proposals.
Vendor responses can be messy: free-form text, tables, maybe attachments, etc.
Use AI to extract the important details from these responses (e.g. prices, terms, conditions) and 
update your system automatically, without the user manually keying in each number.
Compare proposals and recommend a vendor
For a given RFP, show how different vendors compare (e.g. pricing, terms, completeness of 
response).
b.
Use AI to help the user evaluate: summaries, scores, or recommendations are all acceptable.
c.
The system should help the user answer: “Which vendor should I go with, and why?”
You are free to choose:
●
●
●
●
How you structure an “RFP” internally (fields, schema, etc.).
How the UI/UX looks (chat-like, forms, wizards, dashboards, etc.).
How you design the scoring / comparison logic.
Which AI provider / model(s) you use and how you prompt them.
We care much more about your decisions and reasoning than about matching any specific reference 
implementation.
3. Requirements & Expectations
Functional (high-level)
At a minimum, your solution should demonstrate:
●
●
●
●
●
A way to create and view structured RFPs driven by natural language input
Basic vendor management (store vendors, pick them for an RFP)
Email sending of RFPs to selected vendors
Email receiving of at least one vendor response, and automatic parsing of that response with AI
A comparison view for proposals for a given RFP, with some form of AI-assisted evaluation or 
recommendation
How you achieve each of these is up to you.
Technology
●
●
●
Use a modern web stack.
○
Suggested: React (frontend) and Node.js with Express (backend), but you may choose differently if 
you explain why in the README.
Use a database of your choice to persist data (e.g. PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
Integrate with a real email system for send + receive. This can be via SMTP, IMAP, or any email 
API/service.
AI Integration
Use an LLM (OpenAI / Anthropic / etc.) for at least:
●
●
●
Turning natural language procurement needs into some structured representation of an RFP
Parsing vendor responses (email body and/or attachments) into structured data
Helping with proposal comparison and/or recommendations (e.g. explanations, summaries, scores)
You decide where and how heavily to use AI, and how you design prompts / flows.
Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
You do not need to implement:
●
●
●
●
User authentication / multi-tenant support
Real-time collaboration
Email tracking (opens, clicks, etc.)
A full RFP edit lifecycle with approvals, versioning, etc.
Focus on a solid, end-to-end single-user experience.
What We’re Evaluating
We will look at:
●
●
●
●
●
●
Problem understanding & modeling – how you model RFPs, vendors, proposals, and their relationships
Architecture & code quality – structure, separation of concerns, naming, error handling
API & data design – clarity and consistency of your APIs and data models
AI integration – how thoughtfully and effectively you use AI, not just “call an API”
UX – can a user actually complete the workflow without confusion?
Assumptions & reasoning – are your assumptions reasonable and clearly documented?
